# Adventure Works

Adventure Works is an MIT-licensed sample database for SQL Server.  This repository is an attempt to replicate this model (and corresponding data) using SAS datasets.

For various reasons, this is an _imperfect_ copy of the original.  If you would like to contribute to making it better, feel free to submit a pull request!

## Project Setup

First, install the SASjs CLI - `npm i -g @sasjs/cli`.
